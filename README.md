## Game Description
Playground is a video game that tests a player’s patience when faced with seemingly impossible obstacles. 
When the player dies, instead of showing the number of deaths, it is replaced with a positive sentence.

The Player plays as the main character Blinky. When Blinky Jumps, he blinks leaving behind him
a trail showing a few positions that he passed by. Remember he is always 1 second ahead of his past instances.

Patience and timing are keys to success - good luck!
